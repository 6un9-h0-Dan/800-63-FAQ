question: B8
title: What should be in the list of common memorized secrets that is described in SP 800-63B section 5.1.1.2?

Overall, it is important to discourage the use of very common passwords, particularly those that are most likely to be tried in an online password guessing attack. Some passwords that meet requirements of common composition rules are in fact quite common (e.g., Password1!) while others that do not meet composition rules are not common at all.

The dictionary, or blacklist, should contain likely common passwords without particular regard to how they are composed. If passwords with repetitive characters meet that criterion, include them. However, as our forthcoming implementation resource center will point out, the blacklist should not include every conceivable password; that is likely to cause user frustration, which often leads to predictable patterns of behavior that attackers are likely to anticipate.

question: B14
title: Does the guidance on memorized secrets (passwords) apply to system accounts (functional IDs) as well as human users?
---
NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63B provides requirements, recommendations, and guidance for the use of memorized secrets (i.e., PINs, passwords) in authentication of digital identity. This guidance for memorized secrets is exclusively for human users. Specific guidance on memorized secrets for users and verifiers is contained in SP [800-63B Section 5.1.1](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecret). Memorized secret usability considerations (including password complexity and password change rules) are presented in [Section 10.2.1](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memorizedsecrets).  Also, [SP 800-63B Appendix A](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#appA), Strength of Memorized Secrets, provides additional guidance and explanation for the use of memorized secrets as an authenticator for digital identity.

Authentication of other than human claimants (e.g., APIs) is out of scope for SP 800-63-3.

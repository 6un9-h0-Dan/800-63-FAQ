question: B16
title: Are cloud-based verifiers used by government agencies at AAL2 required to meet FIPS 140 requirements?
---
Yes. [SP 800-63B Section 4.2.2](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#aal2req) requires verifiers operated by government agencies at AAL2 to be validated to meet FIPS 140 Level 1. The use of a cloud service by a government agency, although perhaps directly operated by a commercial entity, is still operated on behalf of the government and does not modify that requirement.

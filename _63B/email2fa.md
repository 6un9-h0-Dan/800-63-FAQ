title: Is the use of email acceptable in two-factor authentication?
---
NIST SP 800-63B does not allow the use of email as a channel for single or multi-factor authentication processes. This is specified in [Section 5.1.3.1](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#ooba), Out-of-Band Authenticators:

> [Authentication] methods that do not prove possession of a specific device, such as voice-over-IP (VOIP) or email, SHALL NOT be used for out-of-band authentication.

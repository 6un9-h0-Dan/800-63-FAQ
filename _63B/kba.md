title: Is use of knowledge-based authentication permitted?
---
Knowledge-based authentication (KBA), sometimes referred to as "security questions", is no longer recognized as an acceptable authenticator by SP 800-63. This was formerly permitted and referred to as a "pre-registered knowledge token" in SP 800-63-2 and earlier editions. The ease with which an attacker can discover the answers to many KBA questions, and relatively small number of possible choices for many of them, cause KBA to have an unacceptably high risk of successful use by an attacker.

A similar technique, knowledge-based verification (KBV), is permitted for use in resolving identities and, with restrictions, in remote identity verification during enrollment and proofing. See [SP 800-63A section 5.3.2](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html#kbv) for details.

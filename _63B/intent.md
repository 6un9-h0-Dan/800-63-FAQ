title: What is authentication intent?
---
[Authentication intent](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#529-authentication-intent) is the process of demonstrating that an individual intended to authenticate. Establishing authentication intent – like entering an OTP from a device, inserting a smart card, or simply touching the device (known as proof of presence) – can act as a countermeasure against malware using the endpoint as a proxy for authenticating an attacker without the user’s knowledge. This makes it more difficult for the authenticator to be used for nefarious purposes outside the control of the legitimate user.

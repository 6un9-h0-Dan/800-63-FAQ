title: Are usernames considered personal information?
---
An identifier (username) is considered to be personally identifiable information (PII) if it contains identifying information that links back to a specific person, and is not if it is chosen arbitrarily by the user or is an opaque value that cannot be linked to a specific person. To illustrate, Facebook identifiers are PII because their Terms of Use require the use of your real name. Unverified Twitter handles (without the blue verified badge) may not be considered PII if they cannot be linked to the specific person, although the user profile for the Twitter account usually does contain PII.

Additional guidance can be found in [NIST Special Publication 800-122](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-122/final): Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

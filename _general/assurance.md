title: Is there a template you can share that reflects the new assurance levels, impact levels, etc. per 800-63-3?

The previous e-authentication risk assessment methodology was replaced by new guidelines. The new guidelines consist of 4 volumes:

 – SP 800-63-3 - Digital Identity Guidelines
 - SP 800-63A – Enrollment and Identity Proofing
 - SP 800-63B - Authentication and Lifecycle Management
 - SP 800-63C – Federation and Assertions

 Please refer to [Section 5 Digital Identity Risk Management](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html#sec5) and [Section 6 Selecting Assurance Levels](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html#CYOA) of SP 800-63-3. [Section 5.2 Assurance Levels](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html#5-2) defines the assurance levels for Identity Assurance (IAL), Authentication Assurance (AAL), and Federation Assurance (FAL); these assurance levels replace the previous 4 levels of assurance in SP 800-63-2. [Section 5.3 Risk and Impacts](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html#section5-3) presents methodology for performing risk assessments and impact analyses to determine appropriate assurance levels.

 [Section 6 Selecting Assurance Levels](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html#CYOA) presents direction for selecting appropriate assurance levels based on risk assessments and impact analyses; specifically, [Table 6.1](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html#63Sec6-Table6-1) presents potential impacts by impact category for each assurance level. The three following sections — 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 — present decision trees for the selection of appropriate assurance for each type: IAL, AAL and FAL. Sections 5 and 6 in SP 800-63-3 are intended to be used together as guidance to agencies performing risk assessments, impact analyses, and selection of appropriate assurance levels.

title: Should I always use the highest xAL? How do I know which xAL to choose?
---
There is always a trade-off in choosing the appropriate level across all categories. Higher levels do come with greater security and assurance, but at the cost of greater complexity, overhead, and potential for failure. Therefore, it is not always a matter of choosing the highest possible level and then conforming to that. Instead, the risks and potential attacks against a given application need to be considered alongside the costs of implementing a given level. It is always possible for an implementation of an identity system to exceed the requirements of its levels in practice, and the assurance levels themselves have been designed to be subsumptive, such that fulfilling requirements for level 3 automatically fulfills (and in fact exceeds) the requirements for level 2 and level 1 of that category as well. The [core document of 800-63-3 section 6](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html#sec6) provides detailed discussion on choosing an appropriate combination of xALs.
